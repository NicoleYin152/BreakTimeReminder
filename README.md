# BreakTimeReminder

When users first open the app, they are invited to set up their breaks schedule. 

Users can configure their preferred break-length (e.g. 10 minutes) and frequency of their breaks (e.g. every 60 minutes).

After saving the schedule, users can start or stop the schedule using the app UI.

When it’s time to take a break, the app triggers a push notification that says “It’s break time!”. The app UI will change to show a countdown timer for any given break.

When a break is over, the app sends a push notification that says “Your break is over - time to get back to work”.
